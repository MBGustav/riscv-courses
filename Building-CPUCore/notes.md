# INTRO

Here are some notes about lessons learned through this crash-course 

> ðŸ“˜ __What kinds of architecture actually exists?__
>
> In this course, is presented the type load-store type. Even though, there are other common archictectures that should be mentioned: stack and accumulator.
>
> -__Stack__ : Uses a stack-based hardware in order execute aritmethic-like operations: add, mult and subtrations. This kind operates with instructions based on one-operand. Also, it's operartions cand be generalized on: push, pop and few others arithmetics.
> 
> -__Accumulator__ : Here we have an implicit accumulator to operate. Similar to stack, it's instructions are one-operand based. Also, your operation include load and store, but your structure is based in a single register to accumulate previous operations.




## SPECS
RISC-v Instructions are based on 6 standards (in this course was addressed the main ones).
|TYPE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
|R| Register to Register and loads|
|I| Short Immediate and loads|
|S| Stores|
|B| Conditional Branches, variation from S|
|U| Long Immediates|
|J| unconditional Jumps, variation from U|

Specification of how immediate vector is denoted, in accord to format instruction type.
